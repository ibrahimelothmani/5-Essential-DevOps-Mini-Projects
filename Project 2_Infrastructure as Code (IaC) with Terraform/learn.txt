1. Initialize Terraform:
terraform init

2. Validate the Configuration:
terraform validate

3. Plan the Deployment:
terraform plan

4. Apply the Configuration:
terraform apply

Verify the Deployment
1. Access the AWS Console:
Verify that the VPC, subnets, internet gateway, and EC2 instance
are created in the AWS Management Console.

2. SSH into the EC2 Instance:
Use the private key corresponding to your key pair to access the
EC2 instance:
ssh -i <private-key.pem> ec2-user@<public-ip>

3. Test Connectivity:
Install and configure a basic web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx):
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
echo "Hello, Terraform!" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html

Access the web server in your browser using the instance’s public IP.

Destroy the Resources
To clean up and avoid unnecessary costs, destroy the resources:
terraform destroy


Key Takeaways
1. IaC Fundamentals: Learn to define, provision, and manage infrastructure using Terraform.
2. AWS Resources: Understand the basics of VPCs, subnets, internet gateways, security groups, and EC2 instances.
3. Automation: Automate infrastructure provisioning to minimize manual efforts and reduce errors.
4. Reusability: Build reusable and modular Terraform code for different environments.

This project is a hands-on introduction to Terraform and AWS infrastructure, laying a strong foundation for more advanced DevOps automation and cloud management practices.
